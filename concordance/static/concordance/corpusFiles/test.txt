Sweden has begun implementing a standard 6- hour work day policy in order to improve work-life balance. The main purpose of the policy is to maintain people’s quality of life which is included material and non- material. Economy is a material aspect which included productivity of society. Stress and emotion are related to non-material. Material and non- material are important to maintain the quality of life. The 6- hour work day policy can fulfill the material and non- material needs.

First, citizen can maintain healthy life style which is good for their spiritual health. As mentioned before, the non-material life included stress and emotional change. Those emotion change and stress are related to unpredictable event which a person continues to stay in alert stage and person get exhausted. A lot of works will lead to stress and feel depression. Ameek Grewa relocated from London to Citibank's Nordic headquarters in Stockholm a year ago. He said that under the standard 6- hour work day policy, he can wait until office hours to call or email his customers and at the same time he knew he will not be phoned when he is on holiday so he can spend time with friends and family. Therefore, unpredictable work load will decrease and they can decrease stress and depression. The standard 6- hour work day policy helps citizen to have work-life balance.

Second, citizens can work effectively and increase productivity through the standard 6- hour work day policy. The relationship between hour works and productivity is that employee output falls sharply after a 50-hour work-week according to a study published in 2014 by John Pencavel of Stanford University. He suggested that people work at 35 hours, an additional five hours to the length of the working week has consequences for the effective labor input and it has different from an additional five hours starting at 48 hours. Therefore, the 6- hour work day policy can help to improve the quality of life. Increasing the productivity has better economy. Economy is a material indicator for quality of life.  

Some may criticize that reducing working hours, the boss needs to employ more staff to cover the extra shift. The cost will be increased and it causes the stagnation of wages. But under the 6- hour work day policy, it can create more career opportunities to citizens and the quality of work and productivity will increased because of the effectiveness of work. According to the Svartedalen nursery home, using the 6- hour work day policy, the nursing staffs are happier, less stress and more alert. It can improve the quality of care to patient and the residents are happier to receive better care. Also, it create a new opportunities to employ more nursing staffs. 14 new nurses have been hired to cover the extra shifts.
 Another example is the elderly care home in west Sweden. There are an statistic that nurses works shorter hours are taking less sick leave and report being less stress. Also, the staff can organise more activities such as dance classes, group reading sessions or outdoor strolls for patient which can improve the quality of nursing care. It proves that the 6- hour work day policy can maintain the work- life balancing of citizen in Sweden. 

It is too early to define that the 6- hour work day policy is beneficial to the citizens in Sweden. It needs more investigation of the new policy. But so far it brings work- life balances to the citizens.
